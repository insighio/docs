  - V_ESP : Used for breaking the micro-controller's power line if needed (see custom configurations)
  - GND   : Common Ground
  - S_GND : Electronically-controlled Ground Pin (ground switch through IO12)

- Other Sensor/Control Pins (Input/Output)
  - SCL (IO38) : I²C Control Line (Already Pulled-up)

  - IO43       : UART TXD0 for Debugging/Firmware Flashing using USB-to-Serial Cable (also exposed in separate header "J5")
  - IO44       : UART RXD0 for Debugging/Firmware Flashing using USB-to-Serial Cable (also exposed in separate header "J5")
  - IO4-9      : General I/O, can be used as ADC pins
  - All other pins, except reserved pins mentioned below, can be freely used as digital IOs and power pins with low (up to a few mA) current requirements

- Reserved Pins (Used for internal purposes only)
  - IO3 & IO14  : Measure the battery state (voltage)

**Note**: You could also check the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 Datasheet for further information on the annotated pins

#### Radio/GPS Expansion
##### General Description
- Position: Mid-left
- Type: 1 x 2-row (R3-1 & R3-2) 5-pin Female Socket Header
- Number of exposed pins: 10 x power/analogue/digital pins (IOs)
- Usage
  - attaching insigh.io special radio (LoRa/GPS) add-on board
**Comment:** Information about pins and mapping are provided in the [LoRa radio expansion board]({{< relref "../shields/radio/insighio-shield-lora.md" >}})

#### Special configurations

(Please consult us before making these changes)
- By default R20 (0 Ohm) is not mounted and R15 (0 Ohm) is mounted. In case you need to bypass the charger and power the board solely through a battery then R15 should be removed and R20 should be mounted.
- By default R26 (0 Ohm) is mounted. In case you need to break the micro-controller's power line (e.g. for adding a hardware watchdog) then this should be removed.
