This is a series of inactive hardware boards that are not commercially available. These fall broadly into 2 categories: 

* **Category 1:** Designs that are not actively maintained but may revive if there is new interest. This includes:
  * Sensor or connectivity shields developed mainly for special projects/demonstration purposes
  * Custom "all-in-one" boards which integrate both sensing and connectivity, developed for highly specific customer applications
* **Category 2:** Boards depending on obsolete modules abandoned pernamently.

#### Sensor & Connectivity Shields

- [Air Quality and Vibrations Sensor Board]({{< relref "./insighio-shield-air-quality-and-vibrations" >}})
- [Enhanced Air Quality Sensor board]({{< relref "./insighio-shield-enhanced-air-qual" >}})
- [Communications Expansion Board for enabling **LoRa** connectivity at low VHF frequencies (**169 MHz**)]({{< relref "./insighio-shield-lora-lf.md" >}})

#### Integrated

- [Integrated Cellular Board with support to Load Cell and Analog/Digital sensors]({{< relref "./insighio-cellular-weigh-scale.md" >}})

#### Obsolete

- [Generic host board with support to I²C, Analog and Digital sensors (requires a Pycom module)]({{< relref "./insighio-board-generic.md" >}})
- [SDI-12 compatible host board with RS-485 (requires a Pycom module)]({{< relref "./insighio-board-sdi12.md" >}})
