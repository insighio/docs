This is a series of inactive hardware boards that are not commercially available. These fall broadly into 2 categories: 

* **Category 1:** Designs that are not actively maintained but may revive if there is new interest. This includes:
  * Sensor or connectivity shields developed mainly for special projects/demonstration purposes
  * Custom "all-in-one" boards which integrate both sensing and connectivity, developed for highly specific customer applications
* **Category 2:** Boards depending on obsolete modules abandoned pernamently.
