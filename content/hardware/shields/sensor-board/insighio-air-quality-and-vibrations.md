### Scope
Provide support for **gas monitoring** and **movement tracking**. It is applicable in various use-cases and environments, such as for automated **road hazard detection** when installed in **vehicles** or **indoor air quality monitoring**,when installed in **confined spaces**.

### General Information

|                                  |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host board**                   | [insigh.io main board](../../../board/latest)       |
| **Dimensions (L x W x H)**       | 37.7 x 36.47 x 16.7 mm                                               |
| **Weight**                       | 8 g                                                              |

### Example Applications

-   **Special environment Air Quality monitoring (in-cabin, workspace, mine, underground tunnel)**
    -   CO2 level monitoring
-   **Vehicle monitoring / environment recording**
    -   Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass -> bump detection, slope recording, force metering
