### Operation Modes

#### Sensors supply voltage

- The shield supports 3 different DC supply voltages to power sensors: **5V, 9V, and 12V**.
- Voltage level is selected via the **J2** jumpers set ("blue jumpers"). By **default** (if no jumper is set) the board provides **5V**.
- A **single voltage level** can be selected across SDI-12/Modbus-RTU/Analogue sensors.
- Use the lowest possible voltage to conserve energy.

##### Board Power mode

There are 2 "power"supply modes for the shield controlled via the **J1** jumper. These modes are applied over all sensors.

- **"Continuous power mode"** : It applies continuous DC voltage (5V/9V/12V) even at deep sleep. This is required by some sensors for condensation avoidance (e.g. Oxygen Sensor SO-411 from Apogee) or special measurement procedure (e.g. Evapotranspiration Sensor which requires 30 min averaging or ATMOS41). To enable this, place the **J1** jumper mode to **"REG_ON"** position.
- **"Low-power" mode**: This is a mode optimized for energy consumption. To enable this place the **J1** jumper to the position next to "REG_ON". In this mode, the sensors are powered only during the micro-controller wake-up periods, which is enabled by the firmware.

##### Sensor Power mode

In addition, with the use of jumpers the user may control each sensor's power mode independently.

There are 3 jumper sets:

- **J3** controls the **SDI-12** Sensor Port
- **J4** controls the **Modbus-RTU** Sensor Port
- **J3** controls the **Analogue** Sensor Ports

These jumpers control the following 2 modes, where each mode can be set independently for SDI-12, Modbus-RTU and Analogue sensors.

- **"Always-on" mode** where the sensor data can be **accessed continuously during the power cycle** .
- **"On-demand" mode** where the sensor data can be **accessed only during the measurement cycle**.

Remarks:

- **"On-demand"** mode is the most energy-efficient one and used in most of the cases.
- **"Always-on"** makes sense when used with **"Continuous power mode"** enabled.

##### Pulse Counter Ultra Low Power Operation Mode

- Many devices, like **rain gauges** or **water flow sensors** generate one or more pulses when certain liquid volume has been observed.
- This is different from typical SDI-12/Modbus-RTU/Analogue measurement scenarios, where we need to periodically wake up our IoT device (e.g. once per our hour), take a measurement and then go to deep sleep.
- Instead, with pulse generating sensors we need to continuously "capture" the pulses while not exhausting battery life.
- For this purpose we use a special operating mode called **ULP**, which hosts the pulse counting measurement into an ultra-low processor drawing less than 400uA for up to 5kHz pulse frequencies.
