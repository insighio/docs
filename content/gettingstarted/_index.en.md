- How to attach and power 3rd party external sensors to the node

#### [Platform Setup]({{< relref "./e2e/platform_setup.md" >}})
- What is needed in the Console side to get data from the node

#### [Configure Node]({{< relref "./e2e/configure_node.md" >}})
- How to configure the measurement, network, and data upload parameters of the node

#### [Validate]({{< relref "./e2e/validate.md" >}})
- Check proper operation in the node and the Console sides.

This guide shows how to experience the simplicity of exchanging sensor data end-to-end using insigh.io’s cloud Console in a matter of minutes. Hence, it is a useful starting point for newcomers who want to test the product on an end-to-end basis without delving into the details. However, it is not a replacement of the complete documentation following up on Chapters 2--4.
