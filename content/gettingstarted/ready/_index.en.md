By completing the [Configure Device]({{< relref "../configuration/_index.en.md" >}}) procedure, the device is ready to run the selected scenario and upload the data from the selected measurements.

{{% notice note %}}
**Pro Tip**: the [Configure Device]({{< relref "../configuration/_index.en.md" >}}) procedure is responsible of generating a configuration file that describes the selected board setup, the network configuration and the enabled measurements. This file can be retrieved by downloading file **/flash/apps/demo-console/demo_config.py** from the device. See **[Sample config files]({{< relref "../../firmwareapi/sampleconfigfiles/_index.en.md" >}})** for examples per network technology.
