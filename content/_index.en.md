# Welcome

[insigh.io](https://insigh.io) is an open end-to-end platform that interconnects heterogeneous IoT devices, collects and analyzes data and aids on decision making processes. We bring into play new hardware and software, aiming at lowering the barrier for new users to enter the IoT market and existing users to maintain and expand their fleet.

Within the pages of the documentation you will find **Getting Started** walk-throughs, Tutorials, Examples, APIs and Advanced Topics. The goal is to have a single page of reference when using any insigh.io software or hardware.

Have fun!
