# Welcome

[insigh.io](https://insigh.io) is an integrated IoT hardware and software solution that allows to build and manage custom IoT applications, across different sectors. 

From systematic logging and reporting of sensor readings to remote control and actuation of equipment, insigh.io simplifies end-to-end IoT data provisioning, with the right suite of tools:
* Fully configurable and modular **IoT devices**, able to connect to various sensors and networks
* Open-source deployment-ready **IoT firmware**
* A Cloud platform (**"Console"**) orchestrating remote IoT devices and data management

[insigh.io](https://insigh.io) offers a quick and affordable way to develop and smoothly scale new IoT solutions from scratch:
* Start with a flexible and modular development board
* Pick and place an existing or design a new shield tailor-made to your application and sensors
* Optionally add a connectivity expansion shield when WiFi and Cellular are not enough
* Configure the devices with our open-source Micropython firmware
* Power on, connect to our Cloud Platform and check measurements
* Place the board to the provided outdoor enclosure, attach peripherals, deploy, scale, and forget
* Manage your deployment remotely, access and visualize data from your office

Within the pages of the documentation you will find **Getting Started** walk-throughs, **Hardware Specifications** of the various modules, and **Tutorials** for the Device Configuration and Cloud platform tools. The goal is to have a single page of reference when using any insigh.io software or hardware.

Have fun!
