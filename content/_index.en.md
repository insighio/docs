# Welcome

[insigh.io](https://insigh.io) is an integrated IoT hardware and software solution that allows to build and manage custom IoT applications, across different sectors. From systematic logging and reporting of sensor readings to remote control and actuation of equipment, insigh.io simplifies end-to-end IoT data provisioning, with the right suite of tools:
* A set of fully configurable and modular **IoT devices**, able to connect to various sensors and networks
* An open-source and deployment-ready **IoT firmware**, controlling the devices
* A Cloud platform (**"Console"**) orchestrating remote IoT devices and data management

Within the pages of the documentation you will find **Getting Started** walk-throughs, **Hardware Specifications** of the various modules, and **Tutorials** for the Device Configuration and Cloud platform tools. The goal is to have a single page of reference when using any insigh.io software or hardware.

Have fun!
