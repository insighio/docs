# Firmware APIs

This chapter is focused on documenting all resuable software functionalities that come together with insigh.io firmware.

insigh.io firmware is based on [Pycom's latest firmware release](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-micropython-sigfox/releases/tag/v1.20.2.r4), extending its functionalities with extra libraries as "frozen" modules and demo code.
