A wrapper module for reading values provided by Si7021 I2C Humidity and Temperature Sensor. This is the Integrated Circuit included in the insigh.io board.

### Functions

**si7021.get_reading(sda_pin, scl_pin, vcc_pin=None)**

Returns the temperature and humidity, for given I2C SCL/SDA and VCC pins. If `vcc_pin` is defined it will first power on sensors and it will power off sensors at the end.

Assumes that the i2c address is: **0x40**

```python
from sensors import si7021
(temperature, temperature) = si7021.get_reading('P9', 'P10')
```

- params
  - `sda_pin`: i2c SDA pin.
  - `scl_pin`: i2c SCL pin.
  - `vcc_pin`: (optional) the pin that controls the power to the sensors.
- returns tuple (temperature, humidity)
  - `temperature`: float number with temperature in Celsius
  - `humidity`: float number with relative humidity

    Extensions: Added a wrapper function for getting directly the values
