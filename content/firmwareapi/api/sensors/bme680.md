A wrapper module for reading values provided by bme680 air quality i2c sensor.

### Functions

**bme680.get_reading(sda_pin, scl_pin, vcc_pin=None)**

Returns air quality readings, for given I2C SCL/SDA and VCC pins. If `vcc_pin` is defined it will first power on sensors and it will power off sensors at the end.

```python
from sensors import bme680
(pressure, temperature, humidity, gas) = bme680.get_reading('P9', 'P10', None)
```

- params
  - `sda_pin`: i2c SDA pin.
  - `scl_pin`: i2c SCL pin.
  - `vcc_pin`: (optional) the pin that controls the power to the sensors.
- returns tuple (pressure, temperature, humidity, gas)
  - `pressure`: the atmospheric pressure in heptopascal (hP)
  - `temperature`: float number with temperature in Celsius
  - `humidity`: float number with relative humidity
  - `gas`: gas resistance in Ohm
