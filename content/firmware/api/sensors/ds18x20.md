A wrapper module for reading values provided by DS18X20 temperature sensor.

### Functions

**ds18.x20.get_reading(data_pin, vcc_pin=None)**

Returns temperature reading, for DATA pin. If `vcc_pin` is defined it will first power on sensors and it will power off sensors at the end.

```python
from sensors import ds18x20

temperature = ds18x20.get_reading('P19')
```

- params
  - `data_pin`: the input pin name where the sensor data is connected to.
  - `vcc_pin`: (optional) the pin that controls the power to the sensors.
- returns
  - `temperature`: float number with temperature in Celsius
