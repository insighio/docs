## Overview

A project is the higher-level entity that groups together other entities and services. Devices, channels, dashboards, integrations, plugins and alarms are all linked to a specific project. Users may have access to multiple projects and projects can be shared across multiple users with different roles.

When a user registers to the Console, a new project is created for them by default. Users can create more projects as shown below. Project administrators can also add other users (via invitations) to the project by also assigning them the appropriate role for access control.

## User Roles

User roles are used to authorize access to a project. User roles are defined at the project level and are the following:

- **Administrators** have full project access. They can view, edit, create and delete entities and services within the project. Administrators can also invite other users to the project. When a user creates a new project, they are also administrator of the project.
- **Editors** can view, edit and create entities and services within the project. They do not have the delete permission.
- **Viewers** can only view entities and services within the project.
